# 🚗 Fuel Efficiency Prediction with Machine Learning 🔍📊
📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the WE LEAD - Data Science & Business Intelligence Bootcamp and focuses on predicting city-cycle fuel consumption (MPG) for cars. Given a dataset with car attributes, our task was to classify fuel efficiency into low, medium, and high categories.

By leveraging machine learning, data preprocessing, and feature engineering, this project aims to develop a predictive model that can assist car rental companies in making informed fleet updates
